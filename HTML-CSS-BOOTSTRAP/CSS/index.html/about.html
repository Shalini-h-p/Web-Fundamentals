    <p>Neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles or the female's
      ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of dogs' overpopulation in
      some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
      Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have
      undesired puppies that may later be euthanized. According to the Humane Society of the United States, three to
      four million dogs and cats are euthanized each year. Many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are
      many more animals than there are homes.
